1.The instruction in the trace that causes the incorrect mathematical result is as follows:
544dfc  4a 8d 04 a5 02 00 00 00 lea 0x2(,%r12,4),%rax   rax=7fffffff73ab3b42
It causes overflow so the compiler produces the incorrect result.

2.From data.c, we find the following about most-negative-fixnum:
"most-negative-fixnum" has the value of Vmost_negative_fixnum, which is the smallest value that is representable in a Lisp integer. Also, Vmost_negative_fixnum = make_number (MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM); 
Then, from lisp.h, we find the following about MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM:
#define MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM (EMACS_INT_MAX >> INTTYPEBITS)
#define MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM (-1 - MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM)
As for INTTYPEBITS:
#define GCTYPEBITS 3
INTTYPEBITS = GCTYPEBITS - 1
So INTTYPEBITS=2. Thus MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM is defined as 0x7fffffffffffffff right shifted by 2, which is 0x1fffffffffffffff. Therefore we compute MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM as -1 - MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM, which is exactly -2305843009213693952.

3.We find the following from data.c about how the complier deals with multiplication overflows:
case Amult:overflow |= INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (accum, next, &accum)
In this case, we multiply most-positive-fixnum by itself for four times and thus it definitely will cause an overflow. The most-positive-fixnum has the form 0x7fffffffffffffff, after the operations, it firstly left shifts and then right shifts so that it clears the front bits and only leave 1 at the end. Therefore, the command outputs only1.

4.If we use -fwrapv, the compiler will automatically wrap around when signed arithmetic overflow occurs. As a result, it will produce the incorrect mathematical result without a warning.

5.When I firstly attempt to run the command, the output error says that it is due to either doubule free or corruption. Then I use backtrace command to examine the bug and I find the following lines:
#4  0x00000000005d37d8 in tzfree (tz=<optimized out>, tz@entry=0x147b400) at time_rz.c:194
#5  0x00000000005d3aeb in tzfree (tz=tz@entry=0x147b400) at time_rz.c:190
#6  0x0000000000553d84 in xtzfree (tz=0x147b400) at editfns.c:139
It is clear that double free is involved during the instructions (for tzfree). Therefore, the machine address of the problematic instructions are 0x00000000005d37d8 and 0x00000000005d3aeb.
