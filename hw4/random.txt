A. The expression will always yields 1. (true)
We know that from int to double, the exact numeric value is preserved due to the greater range and precision of double. Then, we convert both x and dx to float. Although the conversion could cause rouding, the rouding behavior would be the same for x and dx. Therefore, the expression is true, always yielding 1.

B. The expression will not always yields 1. (false)
Although the exact numeric value is preserved while converting int to double, double has greater range. For example, when x = INT_MIN, y = 1, (x - y) would overflow. Assuming -fwrapv for signed arithmetic overflow of subtraction, (x - y) will be positive. However, due to the greater range of double, (dx - dy) would have the correct result. Therefore, the expression will not always yields 1.

C. The expression will always yields 1. (true)
The lack of associativity in floating-point addition would not affect the result of this expression because dx, dy, dz are all converted from ints. Due to the greater range and precision of double, the addition here will not cause any problem. Therefore, the expression is true, always yielding 1.

D. The expression will not always yields 1. (false)
The expression would be false due to rounding problems. For example, when dx = 2^30+2^7, dy = 2^30+1, dz = 2^30+1. Due to the round-to-even mode(the default mode), the right side and the left side cannot be equal in this case. (dx*dy)*dz=((2^30+2^7)*(2^30+1))*(2^30+1)=(2^60+2^30+2^37+0)*(2^30+1)=2^90+2^67+2^61, dx*(dy*dz)=(2^30+2^7)*((2^30+1)*(2^30+1))=(2^60+2^30+2^30+0)*(2^30+2^7)=2^90+2^67+2^61+2^39. Thus, the right side and the left side are not equal. Therefore, the expression will not always yields 1.  

E. The expression will not always yields 1. (false)
For example, when dx = 0, dz = 1. dx / dx = NaN, dz / dz = 1, so dx / dx != dz / dz. Therefore, the expression will not always yields 1.
